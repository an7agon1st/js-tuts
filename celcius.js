// idk if you figured out the input taking bit of JS
// if not, lemme tell
// since JS is event loop based, it WONT ASK you for input
// so you need like a package to make it wait and read from the command line
// that package is called "readline" (only in Node)
//
// for the browser, either you can get input from HTML
// or you can assign values in the dev console in chrome (press F12)
